Created an app that detects whether a user has depression or not based on text input. Our team used twitter data and text blob and nltk tokenizer to sort tweets with a low sentiment analysis
and a high sentiment analysis. Then we used this data to predict a users mental health status.

Our hope was to help detect users to display patterns of depression online and help them seek help.
